# evaluation Deep Learning image model

This is  GUI project in python and PyQt5 for evaluate Deep Learning model which works on the image.for this purpose write model instraction in the python file and then upload this file as a python module.The model has been stored at this module is loading dynamicly into python workspace, after loading the model we can load image one by one and use the loaded moedel for get the label of this image. at the end we use the predicted label and true label to evaluate the model.
